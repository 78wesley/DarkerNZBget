Custom CSS to apply to NZBget.

For anyone who doesn't use NGINX, but uses Linux, the script [linux_install.sh](https://github.com/ydkmlt84/DarkerNZBget/blob/develop/linux_install.sh) is now included. Using Linux, download the script and then give it execute permissions with `chmod +x linux_install.sh`.
Run the script and follow any prompts given. If you're currently using the NGINX sub_filter this will need to be removed.

More scripts for different OS' hopefully coming soon.
